# CodeQL Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository
#
# Analyzes Python and Rust code for:
# - Security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, SSRF, etc.)
# - Code quality issues
# - Supply chain risks
# - Common programming errors
#
# Results appear in GitHub Security tab and as PR annotations.
