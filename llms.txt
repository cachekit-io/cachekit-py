# cachekit

> Production-ready Redis caching for Python with intelligent reliability features and Rust-powered performance.

cachekit provides intelligent caching with circuit breaker, distributed locking, Prometheus metrics, and zero-knowledge encryption. Designed for production workloads from simple decorators to complex multi-pod deployments.
